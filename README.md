Data Assimilation using EnKF for HEC-HMS model

This repository contains the necessary steps for data assimilation using Ensemble Kalman Filter:
1) perturbe forcings and model states,
2) read perturbed model states and simulated variables,
3) produce the analisis step to update model states,
4) write model states back to the model native format.

The scripts are designed to complement the configuration of a Delft-FEWS operational system.
